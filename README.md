# Whaddy-Nightlight

![demo](./pictures/demo.png)

Make A Cool Nightlight in the shape of Whaddy! This wil fit on any phone charger in the EU

## Project description - How Does it work?

### What can this project do?
This project uses an Digital light sensor to measure the ambient light. When a certain light value is reached, the 2 SMD RGB leds will turn on and give your room a purple shine!
The enclosure is designed for 3D printing in the shape of our Mascot!
The 3D printed parts are available on our Thingiverse page: "3D print parts". These are designed with a Snap fit connection for the electronic modules and to close it. So you dont have to find screws. 
The nightlight is supported by a bracket (also  3D printed), which is designed for most EU mobile phone chargers.

### You will need to do the following things for the project to work:

### Level of difficulty: Intermediate

## MATERIALS

### Ingredients:
*  Arduino Uno or equivalent (e.g. [Whadda Atmega328 Uno Development Board (WPB100/VMA100)](https://www.vellemanformakers.com/product/atmega328-uno-development-board-vma100/))
* 2.8 Inch colour LCD (Touch Screen) (e.g. [Whadda 2.8 Inch Touch Screen for Development Board (WPSH412/VMA412)](https://www.vellemanformakers.com/product/2-8-inch-touch-screen-for-development-board-vma412/))
* Joystick Module (e.g. [Whadda XY Joystick Module (WPI315/VMA315)](https://www.vellemanformakers.com/product/xy-joystick-module-2-pcs-vma315/))
* Prototyping shield for Arduino® Uno (e.g. [Whadda Arduino® Compatible Expansion Board For Arduino® Uno R3 (INSERT WHADDA CODE/VMA200)](https://www.vellemanformakers.com/product/arduino-compatible-expansion-board-for-arduino-uno-r3-vma200/))

* [Optional] 5 pin Female Header

### Tools:
* PC with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed
* Soldering iron
* Solder
* Stripping pliers
* Cutting pliers
* Shrink tubes
* Heat gun of hair dryer
* 3D printer

## 3D printing the NightLight:

There are no supports needed, Be sure to 3D print the Whaddy in a transparent filament. Otherwise, you won`t be able to see the LEDs inside. 
Also be sure to print it with 100% infill to get the best result.

## PROGRAMMING  the development board

### Dev board: Arduino Uno (compatible)
