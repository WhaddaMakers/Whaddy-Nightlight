# Whaddy Nightlight

![demo](./pictures/demo.png)

Make A Cool Nightlight in the shape of Whaddy! This wil fit on any phone charger in the EU

## Project description - How Does it work?

### What can this project do?
This project uses an Digital light sensor to measure the ambient light. When a certain light value is reached, the 2 SMD RGB leds will turn on and give your room a purple shine!
The enclosure is designed for 3D printing in the shape of our Mascot!
The 3D printed parts are available on our Thingiverse page: "3D print parts". These are designed with a Snap fit connection for the electronic modules and to close it. So you dont have to find screws. 
The nightlight is supported by a bracket (also  3D printed), which is designed for most EU mobile phone chargers.

### You will need to do the following things for the project to work:

### Level of difficulty: Intermediate

## MATERIALS

### Ingredients:
* Arduino Nano or equivalent (e.g. [Whadda Atmega328 Nano Development Board (WPB102)](https://whadda.com/product/atmega328-development-board-wpb102/))
* Light sensor (e.g. [BH1750 dgital light intensity sensor module (VMA341)](https://whadda.com/product/bh1750-digital-light-intensity-sensor-module-vma341/))
* RBG SMD LED modules (e.g. [ARDUINO® COMPATIBLE 3 COLOUR RGB SMD LED MODULE (2 Pcs)(VMA318)](https://whadda.com/product/arduino-compatible-3-colour-rgb-smd-led-module-2-pcs-vma318/))
* PLA naturel (e.g. [1.75 Mm (1/16″) PLA FILAMENT – NATURAL – 750 G](https://whadda.com/product/1-75-mm-1-16-pla-filament-natural-750-g-pla175n07/))
* Soft electrical wires
* Any USB A cable (old one is good enough but it hast to work)

### Tools:
* PC with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed
* Soldering iron
* Solder
* Stripping pliers
* Cutting pliers
* Shrink tubes
* Heat gun of hair dryer
* 3D printer

## 3D printing the NightLight:

There are no supports needed, Be sure to 3D print the Whaddy in a transparent filament. Otherwise, you won`t be able to see the LEDs inside. 
Also be sure to print it with 100% infill to get the best result.

## PROGRAMMING  the development board
